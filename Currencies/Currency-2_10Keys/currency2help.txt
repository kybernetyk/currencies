<center><h2>Offline Mode</h2></center>
<p>The offline mode forces Currency 2 to stay offline and don't update any exchange rates - even if there is a network connection available.</p>
<p>This setting is useful if you know that your network connection is really slow or if internet access is blocked. It also helps to save you on roaming fees when you are abroad.</p>

<center><h2>Quick Access Bookmarks</h2></center>
<p>The quick access bookmarks are found in the green bar on top of the watch list view. Those bookmarks offer you quick access to often used values.</p>
